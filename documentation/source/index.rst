AUTO²
=====

AUTO² or auto-AUTO is an |AUTO| automatic search algorithm codebase
to enhance the original AUTO-07p Python interface with a top layer which allows users to:

* automate the continuation of as many branches as possible, branching whenever possible to construct full
  bifurcation trees, and finishing computations based on a predefined logic
  (meeting other branches, looping branches, etc...)
* plot results with |Matplotlib|
* perform these computation in `Jupyter`_ notebooks
